Feature Plans:
    Overall:
        + improve server architecture by allowing library users to specify their own factories in a simple manner

    HTTPUtils.class:
        + add features for HTTP clients
        + add a method for extracting information from URLs

    Processor.class
        + perhaps streamline the Processor class into a child class, using wrappers for Functions to make
          some aspects of extending Process.class easier and less repetitive
        + change the way matchers are done, so that child classes don't have to copy and paste 10 lines of static code
          every time
